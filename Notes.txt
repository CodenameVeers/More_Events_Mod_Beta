Notes for the Ancient Robots event:

The sequence of events up to and including the point where the EVIL ROBOT ARMIES spawn works but has not been thoroughly debugged. Although some stuff has been coded after that point, I make no promises that it actually works.

Current KNOWN Issues:

> There is no limitation on your ability to recruit robot armies before they turn evil; you're supposed to max out at four.
> It's not clear if this is actually possible, but we'd like the appearance of the robot armies to turn off the planetary fortifications.
> An event should probably occur if you ignore the siege project for too long.
