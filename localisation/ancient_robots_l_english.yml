# Start of Ancient Robots Sequence:

 ancient_robots.201.name:0 "Not the First"
 ancient_robots.201.desc:0 "While prospecting a promising area our colonial mining corporation made a remarkable discovery on [planet_name]. They found fragments of an ancient humanoid robot that seems to be millions of years old. This find also proves wrong our assumption that we were the first intelligent lifeform to inhabit that planet. More thorough scans of this planet will be needed to shed more light on this precursor civilization."
 ancient_robots.201.a:0 "Make it so!"
 
# Initial Scanning Special Project:
 
 ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT:0 "Further Planetary Scans"
 ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Our scientific society urges us to do more thorough scans of [planet_name] to determine promising locations for archeological excavation to uncover more about this ancient precursor civilisation found there."

# Further Scans Performed:
 
 ancient_robots.203.name:0 "Not a Mountain"
 ancient_robots.203.desc:0 "Our scientists were already pleading to finally stop these fruitless scans on [planet_name] when a mountain - or, at least, what we formerly believed to be a mountain - turned out to be something else. What it might be specifically is still unknown but one thing is thing is certain: It is made of metal - a whole lot of it. [Scientist_name] has proposed an excavation to find out what lies under the rock. It will be a costly decision if we choose to do so."
 ancient_robots.203.a:0 "Just do it!"
 ancient_robots.203.b:0 "Ask me again later."
 ancient_robots.203.c:0 "No, and don't ask me again."
 
# Reminder:

 ancient_robots.204.name:0 "Excavation Plans"
 ancient_robots.204.desc:0 "Our scientific society wants to remind you that there is still an unsolved mystery on [planet_name]. Plans for an excavation have been postponed until now. Our scientists ask us again to back their undertaking."
 ancient_robots.204.a:0 "Just do it!"
 ancient_robots.204.b:0 "Ask me again later."
 ancient_robots.204.c:0 "No, and don't ask me again."
 
# Excavation Project:

 ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT_2:0 "Excavating the Mystery"
 ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT_2_DESC:0 "After raising the needed funds the real work can finally begin. To abrade a whole mountain is neither a small feat nor done in one day."
 
# Excavation Completed:

 ancient_robots.206.name:0 "An Ancient Factory"
 ancient_robots.206.desc:0 "Thanks to our previous scans, our teams at the excavation site were not suprised when they found an alien mega structure beneath the thick layer of rock. What did suprise them is that, despite its age of millions of years, it is still largely intact. Our team have already managed to access what seems to be a robot assembly plant with a connected factory for their parts. Some of these robots have been sent away for closer examination. Meanwhile, the science teams will try to establish a forward base inside the structure and hope to be able to power at least parts of the ancient machinery."
 ancient_robots.206.a:0 "Astounding! Go on."

# Someone Else Did the Excavation:

 ancient_robots.207.name:0 "An Ancient Factory"
 ancient_robots.207.desc:0 "It seems some private investors funded an excavation on [planet_name] to find out what mystery lies beneath that anomalous mountain range we found a few years ago. At first they deemed their undertaking to be very profitable but when they realized the significance of their finding, and possible legal actions towards them should they not inform us, they contacted the local governor. Under tons of rock lies an impressive structure formerly used to mass produce some kind of robots. Some units have already been sent away for closer examination while our science teams at the site prepare to reach further into that complex."
 ancient_robots.207.a:0 "A smart decision. Go on."

# Happy Outcome of the Discovery:

 ancient_robots.208.name:0 "A Ghost in the Shell"
 ancient_robots.208.desc:0 "When our scientists managed to connect the factory complex to our colony´s energy grid they accidently initiated a chain reaction activating the whole complex instead of only some parts of it. This lead to a short blackout in our colony before they were able to compensate for the unexpected energy drain. After the initial flurry they noticed small drones flying around the whole area starting to repair structural damage. But the most fascinating find was an AI operating the facility - and despite the fact that this place seems to be of military origin, it is quite docile and accepts us as its new masters."
 ancient_robots.208.a:0 "As it should be."
 
# Robots Attack! - Immediately on Excavation:

 ancient_robots.209.name:0 "King of my Castle"
 ancient_robots.209.desc:0 "When our scientists managed to connect the factory complex to our colony´s energy grid they accidently initiated a chain reaction activating the whole complex instead of only some parts of it. This lead to a blackout in our colony. After getting power up again we received a short, interrupted message from our science team saying that an AI program has taken control of the facility. After this only silence. Intel from our orbital monitoring satellites shows an army of robots pouring out of the facility. The colonial defense force is in high alert."
 ancient_robots.209.a:0 "Send in reinforcements!"
 
# Robots Attack! - After Working For a While

 ancient_robots.210.name:0 "King of my Castle"
 ancient_robots.210.desc:0 "The AI managing the ancient factory on [planet_name] has gone rogue. Armies of robots are pouring out of the complex. Our colonial defense force has been completely caught by surprise and is barely managing to hold its position. They demand immediate reinforcements or the colony might fall."
 ancient_robots.210.a:0 "Send in reinforcements!"

# Victory Over Initial Robot Attack:

 ancient_robots.211.name:0 "Gaining the Offense"
 ancient_robots.211.desc:0 "Our forces have managed to drive the robots back to their source. But an attack on the citadel, as the factory is called by our generals, would be futile without preparation and enough force. They have devised plans for a military campaign to retake the citadel.  As soon as our ground forces are ready we can start the siege."
 ancient_robots.211.a:0 "Start the preparations."
 
# Siege Project:

 SIEGE_PROJECT:0 "Besieging the Citadel"
 SIEGE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Our forces are in place. Artillery fire forces the robots into defense while our forces prepare to make the final push into the breach."

# Robot Analysis Completed:

 ancient_robots.220.name:0 "Ancient Robots"
 ancient_robots.220.desc:0 "These recovered robot units, despite being millions of years old, seem to be of a very advanced design our scientists cannot even begin to recreate with our current level of technology. They seem to be made for a single purpose, that every single part of them screams out: war. We cannot copy them, but our own research on advanced robotics will greatly benefit from this find."
 ancient_robots.220.a:0 "Excellent."
